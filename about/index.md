Hiya! I am a software developer that has been doing full stack development for 3 years, working primarily with React, Typescript, and C#.

Recently, I've been spending my time doing open source development for Chromium - in particular, the accessibility module of the Blink engine. I'm also a board game nerd and have spent way too much time playing Civilization 6. üòÅ
