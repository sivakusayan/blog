    Hey! I'm Sayan.
  </h1>
  <p>
  I'm a software developer with around 3-4 years of experience doing full stack development. 
  In the past, I used to be an infrequent contributor to the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/">Chromium project</a>, primarily in the accessibility module of Blink. 
  </p>
  <p>My open source work has been put on pause for now. I'm currently spending the majority of my time learning systems programming, as I start to transition away from my primarily front-end web development background. ðŸ™‚</p>
