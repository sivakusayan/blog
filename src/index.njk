  <p>Hello! I'm a software developer with 3 years of experience doing full stack development in React, TypeScript, and C#.</p>
  <p>In my free time, I'm also a contributor to the <a href="https://www.chromium.org/chromium-projects/">Chromium project</a>, the code that powers Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. Most of my work has been in Blink, Chromium's rendering engine.</p>
  <p>Feel free to check out <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/q/Sayan+Sivakumaran+status:%22NEW%22">what I'm currently working on</a>, and what <a href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/q/Sayan+Sivakumaran+status:%22MERGED%22">I have already done</a>. You can also check out <a href="/posts">my blog</a>, if you'd like. ðŸ™‚</p>
