Let's include one of my favorite examples from mathematics, a description of transfinite induction. [This is an eloquent one from Stack Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/1343686).\r\n\r\nLet $(X,≿)$ be a non-empty, well-ordered set. For each $x∈X$, define \r\n\r\n$$ S_x\\equiv\\{y\\in X\\mid y\\prec x\\} $$\r\n\r\nto be the set of (strict) predecessors of  $x$. Now suppose that a subset $Y⊆X$\r\n satisfies the following property:\r\n\r\n$$S_x\\subseteq Y\\Longrightarrow x\\in Y\\quad\\text{for any $x\\in X$}.$$\r\n\r\nThe principle of transfinite induction claims that in this case, one has $Y=X$.","post":"rip-relative-addressing-in-x86-64","date":1746151330}
